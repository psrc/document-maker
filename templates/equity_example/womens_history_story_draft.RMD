Women have \href{http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DB_Attachments/2019-0294/UnderstandingHowWomenTravel_FullReport_FINAL.pdf}{\underline{\textcolor{blue}{transportation needs that have not historically been met}}}. The regional transportation system, including transit, was designed around the need to quickly get to work at central locations. Women carry significantly more of the care-giving burden's of society and thus need a system that works safely for traveling with others to a variety of locations at all times of day. Women also represent a large portion of older populations who have unique transportation needs, not well-served by our system built for driving and going to work locations. Women are also more likely to live in poverty and have lower incomes than men.

As the world evolves post-COVID towards greater telecommuting for some people and continued trends in aging, will the transportation system evolve for women?


#### Household Travel Survey
The 2017, 2019, and 2021 household travel surveys collected day-to-day information from households in the central Puget Sound region, such as how we traveled, where we went, how long it took—even where we chose to live and whether we got home deliveries, prior to COVID-19 and after.

This report starts with comparison of travel by gender, during the stable period prior to COVID-19, and then dives into some recent trends that occured in 2021, during COVId-19.  Learn more at the \href{https://www.psrc.org/our-work/household-travel-survey-program}{\underline{\textcolor{blue}{household travel survey webpage}}}.Data from 2017 and 2019 have combined to give a more robust sample size.  You can also \href{https://household-travel-survey-psregcncl.hub.arcgis.com}{\underline{\textcolor{blue}{view the full survey dataset here}}}, including 2017, 2019 and 2021 data. 


notes: 
Fewer women work than men. Women take few work trips, more caregiving related trips, more household chore trips.The transit system was initially designed around traveling to a central city work location- which may not meet women's needs as well as men's (on average).Women live longer than men, so that at older ages there are many more women who have unique travel needs than men.Older people (who tend to be women more often) have more need for transit in off-peak hours and specialized transportation services.Women bike much less than men. Some of this is undoubtedly because of bike network design not being safe for all people.How can the transportation and land use system better accommodate older people, household maintenance and caregiving needs? Addressing these questions will improve the system for all genders.






start with 2017/2019 data; transition to pandemic data?


according to 2021 hhts, 103, 000 women live in a household without a car; 86,000 men

Travel Behavior Trends
Through the analysis in this report, key trends
emerge that differentiate women’s travel patterns
from men’s travel patterns, across all modes. » Across all modes, more women are making many
trips (7 or more) per day than men and more
women than men are not making any trips per day.
This means women may experience more exposure
to travel burdens (cost, stress, or safety risks), or
may be more likely to be isolated or disconnected
from the opportunities that travel affords.
» Women in Los Angeles also make shorter trips
than men, which is potentially driven by workforce
participation rates, location of employment
opportunities, and taking household-serving trips
that tend to be more localized.
» Women’s trips are more varied to a broader spread
of destinations, and are more likely to primarily
serve the needs of someone else.
» Women are more likely to live in a car-free or carlight household, take more trips with other people,
and take fewer single-occupant car trips than men.
» Women are also more likely to carpool or get a ride
from a family member or friend if they don’t have
a driver’s license.
These findings show that women may need to adjust
their own schedule and travel needs to accommodate
others, and in doing so, give up some of their own
autonomy and control over when and how they travel.
Despite these challenges and tradeoffs,
women show ingenuity in arranging their
schedules to meet their travel needs. » Women are more likely to trip-chain, or make
stops along the way to other destinations, and
describe consolidating all their errand trips into
one day where they will have access to a vehicle.
» Women in Los Angeles are also more likely than
men to travel mid-day, with a travel peak around 2
PM when transit service may be reduced.

Among female riders, almost 90% ride the system
more than three days per week.
» 57% of women bring their children on transit.
» Women ride transit because they do not have a
car, because they want to avoid traffic, or because
they do not have a license. Two of these three
reasons indicate that women who ride transit
do so because they have fewer
transportation options, and may
have less access to economic
opportunities as a result.
Still, many women do use transit
to access economic opportunity.
» Over 85% of women riders use
Metro to travel to work or school,
and of those women, 32% also use
Metro to run errands or complete
recreational trips.
Among people who make household
serving trips most frequently,
these trips comprise the same
share for women whether they use
transit or not; for men, the share of
household-serving trips declines if
they are transit users. This shows
that while men are more likely to
find alternatives to using transit to
complete household-serving trips
(using a different mode or taking
fewer trips), women are less likely
to find an alternative, and instead
work to make the transit system work for their needs.
Although the rate of adoption for TNCs like Uber and
Lyft is the same for men and women, women are more
likely than men to report that their transit use has
stayed the same as they have also begun to use TNCs.
» Women are more likely than men to say they use
TNCs for trips that transit does not serve, while
men are more likely to say they use TNCs to reach a
transit stop or station. The trips that are not served
by transit may be related to time or location, as
women’s needs differ from men’s needs by both
time of day and location.
These travel behavior findings point towards many
opportunities to adjust the services provided by Metro
to better meet the travel needs expressed by those
who are using transit. Development of a Gender Action
Plan - or a tactical plan to implement policy, design,
and service changes throughout the agency - would
help to articulate the immediate opportunities and
long-term goals that would create a system that
better serves women. Adjustments to services, vehicle
design, and policy would help minimize the time,
cost, safety, and physical burdens of riding transit
for the more than half of all riders who are women.
» The findings from Understanding
How Women Travel about women’s
mode choices, how likely they are to
travel with others in their care, and
their complex trip-chaining patterns
could all inform adjustments to
Metro’s fare policy to make it more
equitable towards women and more
cost-competitive with driving and
carpooling.
»Findings about women’s trip
purposes and primary responsibility
for household errands could all
inform the way transit vehicles,
transit stations, and bus stops are
designed, so that space for traveling
with others and carrying bags and
other belongings could be better
accommodated.
»Findings about when women are
traveling and average trip lengths
could inform new service offerings
that meet a mid-day peak travel
demand and provide better direct
connections over long distances while
minimizing transfers. 


Vehicle access issues disproportionately affect women. 

Financial access also disproportionately
affects women. Low-income women, in
particular, carry a disproportiona

Women make more trips for care-giving purposes like escort passengers, shopping, household errands, and less trips for work and school. 
The transportation system is set up for people to get quickly to work.

PUMS data shows women are employed more than men, but not to the extent the trip purposes diverge. Women who are working are still carrying more burden of other household tasks.

Women take shorter more local trips, as opposed to long highway trips. The transportation system needs to be set up for people getting to a variety of locations by a variety of modes.

Women in households with more than two people tend to travel more with other people than men. Transit is often not well set up for people who are traveling with strollers. The walk and bike network are not built out for people of all ages to use.

Women represent a greater share of the older population who needs more specialized transportation services, and less service to work locations.  https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/03/health/elderly-living-alone.html

THe bike network is not well-suited for women's needs because it feels unsafe for people of different ages and abilities. As a result, in 2019 only 30,000 bike trips were made by women but 74,000 men.

COVID-19 brought about abrupt changes to the transportation landscape. The 2021 Household Travel survey showed big changes in travel behavior. More people were walking and biking, and less people were using transit. Many more people began to telework. Women teleworked more than men, before COVID-19, and the data shows this difference increase even more in 2021. In 2021, 41% of women teleworked, as compared to 33% of men. The difference between telework rates relates to women's job sectors as compared to men, and also household responsibilities.

Increase in telecommuting may be a double edged sword for women- still have hh responsibilities; but also juggling work

                                scale_x_discrete()

```

In 2021, people were traveling for different purposes.
